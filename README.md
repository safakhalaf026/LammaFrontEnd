# 🗺️ Lamma
Lamma is a location-based community services platform built using RESTful conventions. It allows users to discover nearby services on an interactive map, while enabling service providers to create, manage, and receive reviews for their services.


## 🧩 About the Project
Lamma connects neighbors by allowing service providers to list services and customers to discover them using a live, interactive map. Services are displayed as map markers based on geographic coordinates, making it easy to explore what’s available nearby. Users can view service details, leave reviews, and track ratings, creating a trusted and community-driven platform.
